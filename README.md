- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @fhubeaut. I'm an Industrial Engineer from Argentina. 
- Im currently learning about Machine Learning and building my first predictive models. This comes from an early interest in data and spreadsheets. 
- I remember being proficient with Excel at an early age and in my recent years I've been learning more about data and data analysis, and subsequently
- some useful tools and programming languages (SQL, VBA, Power BI, DAX, Tableau and Python)
- 
- I also enjoy sports a lot and playing my guitar.
